# From-Clicks-to-Deliveries-Maximizing-E-commerce-Performance-with-Real-Time-Data-Integration

**Project Overview**
The project aims to integrate and optimize an e-commerce platform with logistics management by leveraging real-time data streams. We are focusing on two key areas:
**1.	Online Platform Optimization:**
Analyzing clickstream data to understand customer behavior, enhance user experience, and optimize marketing strategies for key product categories like mobile phones, laptops, and cameras.
**2.	Fleet Management and Logistics Optimization:**
Monitoring real-time telemetry data from a fleet of delivery trucks to optimize routes, reduce fuel consumption, and ensure vehicle safety and reliability.
**Why We Are Doing This**
**•	Customer Experience:** Understanding customer preferences through clickstream data helps in personalizing the shopping experience and targeting marketing efforts effectively.
**•	Operational Efficiency:** By monitoring and analyzing truck data, we can reduce operational costs, minimize vehicle downtime, and ensure timely deliveries, all of which contribute to better customer satisfaction.
Steps and Code Implementation
**1. Data Generation**
**Purpose:** Generate random data for both the e-commerce platform (clickstream data) and the fleet management system (truck telemetry data). This simulated data will be used to mimic real-world scenarios.
**Explanation:**
We define a list of items and generate random Click Count for each item to simulate user interactions on the platform.
**Truck Telemetry Data Generation:**
**Explanation:**
Similar to clickstream data, we generate random telemetry data for trucks. The data includes GPS location, engine diagnostics, vehicle health, and environmental conditions.
**2. API Creation**
**Purpose:** Create an API to expose the generated truck telemetry data, which will be used by other components for real-time processing.

**Explanation:**
We use Flask to create a simple REST API. The /api/trucks endpoint returns the generated truck telemetry data in JSON format.
**3. Data Streaming with AWS Kinesis**
**Purpose:** Stream the generated data in real-time for processing by downstream services like AWS Lambda.
**Explanation:**
We use the AWS Boto3 library to send data to AWS Kinesis streams. Separate functions handle streaming for clickstream and truck telemetry data.
**4. Data Processing with AWS Lambda**
**Purpose:** Use AWS Lambda to process the streamed data, performing analysis and computation of insights.
**Explanation:**
The Lambda function processes each record from the Kinesis stream. This could involve aggregating data, triggering alerts, or storing processed results in a database.
**5. Data Storage with Snowflake/DynamoDB**
**Purpose:** Store processed data for long-term storage and analysis, using a Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) schema for truck telemetry data.
**Explanation:**
The DynamoDB table uses truck_id and timestamp as composite keys to manage the SCD Type 2 schema. Each new entry is stored with a unique timestamp, preserving the historical data.
**6. Streamlit Presentation**
**Purpose:** Create an interactive dashboard to visualize both clickstream and truck telemetry data, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.
